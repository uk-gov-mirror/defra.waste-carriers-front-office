  <h2 class="heading-medium">Using this website</h2>
  <p>
    The Register as a Waste Carrier service is run by the Environment Agency.
    We want as many people as possible to be able to use this website. For
    example, that means you should be able to:
  </p>

  <ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>change colours, contrast levels and fonts</li>
    <li>zoom in up to 200% without the text spilling off the screen</li>
    <li>navigate most of the website using just a keyboard</li>
    <li>navigate most of the website using speech recognition software</li>
    <li>
      listen to most of the website using a screen reader (including the most
      recent versions of JAWS, NVDA and VoiceOver)
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>We have also made the website text as simple as possible to understand.</p>
  <p>
    <a rel="external" href="https://mcmw.abilitynet.org.uk/">AbilityNet</a> has
    advice on making your device easier to use if you have a disability.
  </p>

  <h2 class="heading-medium">How accessible this website is</h2>
  <p>We know some parts of this website are not fully accessible:</p>

  <ul class="list list-bullet">
    <li>we link to some PDF documents that are not fully accessible to screen reader software</li>
    <li>you cannot skip to the main content when using a screen reader in Internet Explorer</li>
    <li>for registrations, the beta banner has insufficient contrast</li>
    <li>on some screens, the page title tag does not match the headings</li>
    <li>
      the code used to build the site does not correctly validate for some
      screens, which may make it difficult for users of assistive technology to
      read what’s on every page
    </li>
    <li>
      screen readers may not identify forms, headings, links and tables
      correctly and consistently
    </li>
  </ul>
