# Use the defra ruby mocks engine to add support for mocking external services
# in live environment. Essentially with this gem added and enabled the app
# also becomes a 'mock' for external services like companies house.
# This then allows us to performance test our services without fear of being
# reported for causing undue loads on the external services we use.
# With the environment properly configured, when any app in an environment needs
# to call Companies House, instead it will call this app which will mock the end
# point and return the response expected.
